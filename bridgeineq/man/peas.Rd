\format{
A \code{data.frame} with 4 rows and 2 variables:
\describe{
  \item{peas}{Crossbreeds that are categorized as 'roundYellow', 'wrinkledYellow', 'roundGreen', or 'wrinkledGreen'.}
  \item{counts}{The number of plants assigned to a one of the crossbreed categories.}
}
}
\usage{
data(peas)
}
\description{
This data set, "peas", provides the categorization of crossbreeds between a plant variety that produced 
round yellow peas with a plant variety that produced wrinkled green peas. This data set contains the categorization
of 556 plants that were categorized either as (1) round and yellow, (2) wrinkled and yellow, (3) round and green, 
or (4) wrinkled and green.

\examples{
data("peas")
# Prior specification 
# We assign a uniform Dirichlet distribution, that is, we set all concentration parameters to 1
a <- c(1, 1, 1, 1)     

counts <- peas$counts
factor_levels <- levels(peas$peas)
# Test the following mixed Hypothesis:
# Hr: roundYellow > wrinkledYellow = roundGreen > wrinkledGreen 
#
# Be careful: Factor levels are usually ordered alphabetically!
# When specifying hypotheses using indeces, make sure they refer to the correct factor levels.
Hr <- c('1 > 2 = 3 > 4') # translates to: roundGreen >  roundYellow    = wrinkledGreen > wrinkledYellow 
# To avoid mistakes, write out factor levels explicitely:
Hr <- c('roundYellow > wrinkledYellow = roundGreen > wrinkledGreen')

out <- multBayesInformed(factor_levels, Hr, a, counts, bf_type = 'BFre')
summary(out)
